                    A work in progress. I created this project to showcase my skills to potiential employers, I am
                    constantly improving my portfolio depending on the skills that I may know
                    at a given point in time. This project will evolve as I learn other tools and improve my design
                    skills. The website that you're on right now is the improved version of this proejct, if you want to
                    see how the previous version of my online portfolio looked like,

                    Created a web app called Organize4Me for my very first Hackathon competition, HackaBull. Organize4Me
                    is a tool that aids students organize their course work, course lectures, and assignments. It also
                    provided a feature that allowed students to use the known Pomodoro learning technique.

                    This was the final project of my CDA 3103 Computer Logic and organization course.
                    This project was completed in a group of 3, each one of the group members was in
                    charge of different functions of the project. The project required us
                    to simulate the datapath of the MIPS processor, based on the different instructions
                    the program was given (in binary) it should execute different actions.
