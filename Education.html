                    I attended the International Baccalaureate program at Strawberry Crest High School. While at
                    Strawberry Crest, I was involved in the Interact club (a community service club), the National
                    Honor Society, the French Honor Society and a few other sport clubs. I graduated in
                    May 31<sup>st</sup>, 2019.

                    Attended UCF for a year, from June 2019 to May 2020. While at UCF, I did not know what I
                    wanted to study, so I was bouncing between Health science and Biology. In the fall semester,
                    I took an Introduction to Programming with C course, I ended up loving programming and decided
                    I wanted to study computer science. I then transferred to USF, because it was located in my
                    home city and closer to home.

                    I haven't been able to fully get involved with student organizations, however I'm a

                    is the professional development of it's members.
